# ServiceLink Dispatching Platform

ServiceLink is a dispatching platform for communicating with technicians (locksmiths, garage door technicians, plumbers, etc.) and job lead generators. The app allows dispatchers to accept/reject job leads, assign technicians, manually enter job values, and view weekly reports summarizing amounts needed to be paid to stakeholders.
