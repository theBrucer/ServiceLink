# Leadeem Dispatching Platform

Leadeem is a dispatching platform for communicating with technicians (locksmiths, garage door, plumbing, etc.) and job lead generators. The app allows dispatchers to accept/reject job leads, assign technicians, manually enter job values, and view weekly reports summarizing amounts needed to be paid to stakeholders. 

The application is currently being developed, and can be viewed at [dev.leadeem.com](https://dev.leadeem.com/)
