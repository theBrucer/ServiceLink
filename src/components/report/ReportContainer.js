				Things to add here:
				<ul>
					<li>How many texts have been sent this cycle</li>
					<li>How many jobs were received, accepted and rejected from lead generators</li>
					<li>Total value of all jobs completed, number of jobs still missing their value (until received, hard to determine the rest of the analytics)</li>
					<li>How many jobs each technician received, accepted and rejected</li>
					<li>How much money is owed to lead generators = total jobs accepted * fee per job</li>
					<li>How much money is owed to technicians = total jobs accepted * value of the job * commission rate</li>
					<li>The ability to see this for previous weeks (on a cyclical basis). One day, we'll give the option to across custom dates that the user can select</li>
					<li>The ability to export the described information above to CSV - Edon is it necessary? What should it look like?</li>
